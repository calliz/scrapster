Scrapster is a powerful web scraper built in Java. Using Spring's reactive WebClient and Jsoup library, it efficiently scrapes and processes various web content.

Features
Web Scraping: Scrapster scraps the provided website, extracting resources like HTML, CSS, JS, and images.
Concurrency Limit: To prevent overwhelming the client or server with requests, concurrency is limited in certain operations using Spring WebFlux streams.
Offline Browsing: The URLs in the scraped content are modified to facilitate offline browsing. Navigate the downloaded website on your local machine similar to online browsing.
Efficient: Scrapster avoids re-visiting the same web pages, saving time and resources, thanks to its in-built tracking mechanism.
User-Friendly: This command-line tool accepts the scraping target URL as a command-line argument. A default URL is used in the absence of a user-provided one.

Usage
You can run Scrapster in the command line, providing the URL you wish to scrape as an argument like so:
java Scrapster https://example.com

In cases where you do not provide a URL, it defaults to a predefined URL.

Technology and Libraries Used
Scrapster uses advanced technologies and libraries to carry out its tasks:
Java 18 for its rich set of features.
Spring's reactive WebClient for non-blocking HTTP requests.
Jsoup for parsing HTML content, and data extraction and manipulation.
SLF4J for logging during the application lifecycle.
Ensure that you've installed the correct Java version and included necessary libraries in your classpath prior to compiling and running the program.
